<h2>Dependencies:-</h2>
<ul>

<li>NumPy</li>
</ul>

<p>Directory <b>segmented_img</b> contains the individual characters of input 
image.</p>
<p>Sorry, I didn't had much time to make this programe easy to use. There are 
many hard thresholds and input image have to set in the code itself.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

Input Image
![Input Image](./img_3.jpg)e

In between processing:

![pre-process](./final_images_thres.jpg)
![preprocess](./final_images_src.jpg)

Final Output: Here we get single image corresponding to each letter in the text.
